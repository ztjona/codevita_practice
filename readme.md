# Information
This repository contains solutions in python3 of the practice challenges published by the TCS Code Vita contest 2020.
## Summary
The following items show the results on every tried challenge:

* Swayamvar: Presentation error
* Digit Pairs: Wrong answer on private cases

### Note
Presentation error means that it is correct, but in a different "format" than required.

Wrong answer on private cases means that it passed the public cases but not the private ones. Maybe because the statement was misunderstood.

## About the problems

## Important tips about the contest
* Avoid using non standard characters such as é, ñ, etc in your code. Even in the comments.
